This repository is for exercises in Part 1 of Full Stack Open (FSO), "Introduction to React" - https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1

The exercises in this part are all basic front-end-only web apps built in React. They use basic react, passing props between components (including event handler functions), and state manipulation through the react useState hook.

There are three projects contained in this repository, each in their own subfolder:
* /course_information - a web app that displays for a course titled 'Half Stack application development' its parts (or sections), and how many exercises are in each part
* /unicafe - a web app that collects feedback for a university cafe, either as 'good' 'neutral' or 'bad', and then displays statistics of the feedback received
* /anecdotes - a web app that displays software engineering anecdotes, and allows the user to 'vote' for anecdotes they like
