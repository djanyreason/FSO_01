This folder contains the anecdotes project which is developed in exercises 1.12-1.13 of Full Stack Open part 1: https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/a_more_complex_state_debugging_react_apps#exercises-1-6-1-14

This web app displays software development anecdotes and allows the user to vote for anecdotes when they are displayed. It displays a random anecdote from a hardcoded list of anecdotes, and shows the number of votes that anecdote has received.

The current version of Full Stack Open part 1 for exercise 1.14 also asks to display the anecdote with the most votes. This is not implemented here - I am not sure if I missed this when doing this material, or if it has changed in the interim.

This project is built using React. It involves managing state variables using the useState hook, passing event handler functions as props to other components, using the javascript array map function, and properly updating state array functions by creating a new array to replace the prior array in state.
