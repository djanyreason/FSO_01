This folder contains the university cafe project which is developed in exercises 1.6-1.11 of Full Stack Open part 1: https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/a_more_complex_state_debugging_react_apps#exercises-1-6-1-14

This web app receives feedback for a university cafe. There are buttons for 'good', 'neutral', and 'bad' feedback. At the bottom of the page, it displays statistics for all feedback received.

This project is built using React. It involves managing state variables using the useState hook, and passing event handler functions as props to other react components.
